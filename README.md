Company information has many purposes, from use by the Government for tax collection and regulation, to due diligence, to anti-corruption activities. Yet much of this information is locked away in formats inaccessible to those without the skills and resources to mine them, such as PDFs.
One such buried source is the annual reporting of companies registered in the UK. Published annually as a requirement of the law (for certain company types), these reports are made public, for free, on the Companies House website. However they are in PDF format, and so the information contained within them, such as salaries of senior employees, shareholder information, and whether or not the company accounts are qualified are locked away. This project aims to make some of that data available in a structured, searchable format, adding a rich new data source to the existing data on company ownership.
